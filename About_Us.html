            <h4>Michelle Morris</h4>
              <p> I'm in the 11th grade and go to Inglemoor High School. I have played the violin from the 4th grade, and have played volleyball from 7th grade.
                  I never thought coding would interest me, and everytime my dad volunteered to teach me, I would turn him down. Once I came to Girls Who Code,
                  I realized how cool coding was and how important it is to know how to code, especially since our world is becoming so tech oriented.</p>

          <h4>Catalina Lemus</h4>
              <p> Hello, my name is Catalina Lemus! I am entering 11th grade in the fall of 2017 at Auburn Riverside High School.
                  Some of my interest include swimming, tennis, student council, and playing the Viola.
                  I am pasionate about God, Harry Styles --- oh, and of course coding! I had never considered entering the field of computer science before Girls Who Code
                  but the experience has truly opened my eyes and turned my world upside down.
                  I believe in the importance of empowering and aiding each other as humans,
                  and I hope that through this website we can help other teens reach their full potential by easily providing valuable resources to them.  </p>

            <h4>Rebekah Jacobsen</h4>
              <p>Hi!  My name is Rebekah.  I am going into the 11th grade.  I really enjoy coding, but I never had the opportunity to learn it until I came to Girls Who Code.  
                My favorite part about programming is the logic behind the code.  It is absolutely fascinating!  I have always enjoyed logical subjects,
                and coding is definitely one of my favorites!  We have all worked really hard on this project, and I hope you find it enjoyable and helpful.  </p>

            <h4>Alex Eller</h4>
              <p>Hey I'm Alex! Sabrina is my real name but I prefer to go by Alex. I am a rising junior at Auburn Riverside High School. My dream job is an astrophysicist
              and also potentailly an astronaut. You are probaly thinking why would someone who is borderline obsessed with space got into coding and making websites.
              I always wanted to know how to code just to know how incase it was needed in my future and recently I realized that there are alot of jobs that incorperate
              astrophysics and computer science. Design is something that has always intrested me and so when we got our final projects I immedietly wanted to be on the
              design area.</p>
